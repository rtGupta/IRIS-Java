# IRIS

## Problem Statement

- Not every 911 call is a true emergency.
- Emergency Response Systems become unnecessarily burdened with non-emergent cases.
- First Responders and critical equipment get diverted from real emergencies. 
- Potential delay in care for emergent, life-threatening cases.

## Business Idea 

- IRIS attempts at connecting low-acuity 911 callers with primary care resources within the community.

- A digital solution to triage non-emergency complaints through immediate telehealth support with instantly available and qualified emergency physicians.

- IRIS eligible patients to be schedule either for primary care physician along with arranged transport other than ambulance, local voluntary clinicians, or home care prescribed by physician.
